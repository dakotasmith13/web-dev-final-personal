# Dakota Smith - Website Development Final Project

I worked with my roommate to create this website about her Miata that she had just purchased. We were required to include a form and table.

This project was my first exposure to end to end web dev. We created everything from scratch, with no template. I am most proud of the "Explore More Mazda Models"
section on the bottom of the homepage. I realized that the site might need something more interesting, and implemented that myself.
